# ML Codec Research Framework - Requirements
# For live video streaming ML codec research

# Core ML/Deep Learning
torch>=2.0.0  # PyTorch for neural network models
# onnxruntime>=1.15.0  # ONNX Runtime for optimized inference (install when needed)

# Video Processing
av>=14.0.0  # PyAV for video codec operations (H.264, VP8, VP9)
opencv-python>=4.8.0  # OpenCV for image processing and video I/O

# WebRTC (for baseline streaming)
aiortc>=1.13.0  # WebRTC implementation for Python

# Scientific Computing
numpy>=2.0.0  # Numerical operations

# Quality Metrics (optional, for SSIM calculation)
# scikit-image>=0.20.0  # For SSIM calculation (currently using custom implementation)

# Note: scikit-image is not required as we have a custom SSIM implementation
# Install manually if needed: pip install scikit-image
